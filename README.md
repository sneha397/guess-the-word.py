## 🕹️ Guess the Word Game (Python)
A simple and fun 3-stage word guessing game built in Python with a time challenge!  
Complete each word within 10 seconds, or the game ends!
## ✅ How It Works
- You'll be shown a word with missing letters (e.g., `_a_t`)
- You must fill in the correct letter(s) within 10 seconds
- If correct → You move to the next stage
- If wrong or time runs out → Game Over
## 🚀 Stages
1. `C_A_T` → Fill the first letter  
2. `A__LE` → Fill two missing letters  
3. `CAM__` → Fill the last three letters
## 🧠 Concepts Used
- `time.time()` for countdown
- Lists and string joining
- Nested conditionals
- Basic scoring
